# Coupling, Consistency, and Cohesion

This is a talk about boundaries and some heuristics for finding them in systems, with a nod to how those boundaries map to serverless architectures.

If you just want to read the slides online, you can find a slightly manky version at https://bobthemighty.github.io/talk-boundaries/ which I'll clean up one day. Note that some of the prose is inconsistent and there's bits missing because these were my notes, rather than a polished work for publication.

To serve the talk, run `npm run serve`. The talk uses RevealJs, so you can see the speaker notes by hitting `s` in the opened browser window.
