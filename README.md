# Coupling, Consistency, and Cohesion

This is a talk about boundaries and some heuristics for finding them in systems, with a nod to how those boundaries map to serverless architectures.

To serve the talk, run `npm run serve`. The talk uses RevealJs, so you can see the speaker notes by hitting `s` in the opened browser window.

This branch is mangled to run under github pages, so includes revealJS in committed node_modules, which remains under MIT license.

Remaining content is under Creative Commons 0, so do what you like.
