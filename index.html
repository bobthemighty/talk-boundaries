            This is a talk about how to find boundaries in software. It's a
            high-level, theory heavy affair, so I'm not going to tell you how to
            find those boundaries, but I'm going to try and give you some ways
            to think about boundaries that I find useful.

              I'm Bob. I am currently an engineering coach at Cazoo where I used
              to be the chief architect. You can find me on Twitter, and the
              slides will all be uploaded to Github, including most of the words
              I'm saying, because I like to write things out in long-form. This
              is actually the last talk I'm going to do as a Cazoo employee,
              because I'm joining a new company - CarbonRe - working to
              decarbonise heavy industry.

            <aside>
              I'll be hanging around after the talk if you want to chat about
              the contents of the talk, or if you want to talk about climate
              change. If you're worried about the climate, but never talk about
              it to anyone - you're not alone! We're all terrified, and I'd love
              to chat about it. I'm also on a personal mission to get as many
              smart people as possible into climate-tech startups, so if you
              want to know how to find companies who are hiring to tackle
              climate change, come and have a chat. I'd also love to talk to
              people who think "I could do that" but never found the courage to
              give a talk for themselves. It's actually easier than you think.

            <h1>Why does this matter?</h1>

            <aside>
              <p>
                Why this talk? Partly because when the organisers asked me to
                take part, I was halfway through writing a course on software
                architecture, and this is the stuff I was thinking about. Mostly
                because I think we don't spend enough time talking about the
                fundamentals. Lots of people in software talk about libraries
                you can use, or techniques you can apply, or services that are
                available, but we rarely go back to basics and talk about the
                principles that help us to make good choices.
              </p>
              <p>
                I've been working at Cazoo for a few years. For those of you who
                don't know, Cazoo is an online car dealership - we buy cars from
                auction, we fix them and make them look pretty, then we sell
                them on our website and deliver them to your house. It's like
                Amazon for second hand cars.
              </p>
              For a while we were probably the fastest growing business in the
              whole world. We built the first version of our system in about 90
              days from start to finish, we made £100M in our first year of
              trading, and after 18 months we launched on the NYSE for $8bn.
              <p>
                So people would say to me, you've built this thing in about five
                minutes, what kind of scaling problems do you have?
              </p>
              <p>
                And I'd inevitably say that actually we'd used Lambda, and
                Dynamo, and these serverless technologies so scaling wasn't a
                problem for us at all. Amazon are very good at scaling those
                technologies and we outsource all the operational stuff to them.

              <p>
                The thing that's hard is figuring out how to take this huge
                problem - e-commerce, car finance, deliveries, refurbishment,
                pricing, and so on, and divide it up in a way that makes sense
                so you can deliver it very quickly.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is the stuff - boundaries and how to design software
                systems - that we'll ask you about if you come to Cazoo to
                interview as a principal engineer or architect and - when I
                interview for those roles - people very often don't have a good
                mental model.

                The boundaries of things are important, because they are hard to
                change later, and they will screw you up in painful and
                unforeseen ways if you get them wrong.

              The first and most fundamental lens we're going to talk about is
              coupling. What is coupling? Usually when we talk about coupling in
              software engineering, we mean that when one part of a system
              changes, we have to change other parts in response.

          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>Coupling is <em>necessary</em></h3>
            <aside>
              We can't complete eliminate coupling from our code. If we did, our
              code wouldn't be able to do anything useful. Coupling is just a
              consequence of one thing talking to another. You can invent a
              fancy system for wiring things up at runtime so that they're not
              coupled, but that just moves the coupling to somewhere else -
              usually to the magical system you've invented, and that's often
              not a wise trade-off. People often have a simplistic view of
              coupling, though. In particular, lots of engineers will tell me
              that coupling is bad, but Reuse is good.

            <h3>Re-use is coupling</h3>

            <aside>
              One of the classic dicta of software engineering is DRY - don't
              repeat yourself. IF you follow this rule, things end up coupled.
              Why? Because if you don't repeat yourself, so that every piece of
              knowledge is in one place, then every part of the system that
              depends on that knowledge is coupled to that one place.
            </aside>

          <section>
            <h3>API Types are repeated!</h3>
            <img src="assets/img/API_and_clients.png" class="r-stretch" />

            <aside>
              Let's imagine you work for a company who build web applications,
              and your company builds a bunch of APIs and BFFs and
              micro-frontends and all that jazz. Some smart ass says "hey, our
              front end applications need to know what the API responses will
              look like - that's a violation of DRY. Let's create an npm package
              so that all our API types are in one place and can be shared
              between client and server".
            </aside>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h3>DRY is not an improvement</h3>
            <img
              src="assets/img/API_and_clients_shared_types.png"
              class="r-stretch"
            />
            <aside>
              This is a terrible idea that will not die. It's a terrible idea
              because every change to your API now requires a matching change in
              all of the clients. You have _coupled_ two things that should have
              been independent because of this broken idea of DRY.

            <p>but we have to be <em>mindful</em> of coupling</p>

            <aside>
              Is reuse BAD? No, of course not. Reuse is good, DRY is a useful
              heuristic, but reuse means coupling. Is coupling bad? No, it's
              necessary, but we have to be _mindful_ about what we're coupling
              and why.

            <h1 class="r-stretch">Things that change together ship together</h1>
            <aside>
              The first heuristic we should use is this one: things that change
              together ship together. What does this mean? It means that if you
              have two functions, two classes, two APIs, whatever and whenever
              you change one of them you also change the other? You should
              deploy those things together. Don't pretend that these two things
              are independent, because they're not - they're coupled. If you
              want to ship two things independently, you have to uncouple them,
              even if that means copying code, or copying data. Re-use is not
              your friend here.

            />
            <aside>
              Things that change together go in the same module, in the same
              class, in the same package, in the same system. Generically, we
              say that they form a _Deployment boundary_. A deployment boundary
              is a line we can draw where everything inside the line is deployed
              at the same time and everything _outside_ of the line is not.

          <section>
            <h2>Small is beautiful</h2>
            <aside>
              Note: I hope everyone sees that we want deployment boundaries to
              be small, ideally. A smaller deployment boundary means less stuff
              to test when we deploy. It means less stuff that can be broken
              when we make a change. If I have a system and I divide it up into
              three deployment boundaries, then I can have three teams all
              working in parallel making changes to their thing, and they can
              ship whenever they like.

            <aside>
              These days, of course, we do this through microservices. The
              original microservices paper was written by some people from
              Thoughtworks who had been experimenting with dividing up a project
              into smaller pieces so that they could deliver those pieces in
              parallel. This is what Cazoo did, too. Right from the beginning,
              we spun up multiple teams, and those teams tackled smaller pieces
              of the whole massive problem.

              Each of our microservices is a cloudformation stack. It goes in
              its own github repository, because it all deploys together, and we
              use the Serverless Framework to define the resources that we use.

            <h3>Lambdas are (usually) not microservices</h3>

            <aside>
              Please note that a single Lambda function is probably _not_ a
              service by itself. A service can have many components. In
              particular, we might have a single database that is accessed by
              multiple functions. Such functions are coupled. A change to the
              "add to cart" function might involve changing the way we store
              data in the database, and if the database changes, so will the
              "remove from cart" function. Things that change together ship
              together, so all of the functions that use this database have to
              ship together - they form a single deployment boundary.

            <aside>
              By this point, everyone knows that microservices shouldn't share a
              database: this is why - if two components share a database, then
              changes can ripple from one to the other. The only way to avoid
              that is for the components to _not_ share any database objects, at
              which point they're really using two different databases.

            <aside>
              <p>
                We might also have a domain model that's used by multiple
                functions. Imagine we're asked to build an application for
                managing books at a library. We need a function for checking
                books in, a function for checking books out, maybe we need a
                function that lets us search for a particular book, or a
                function that lets us reserve a book and so on. It's likely that
                we want to have a shared codebase across these functions.
              </p>
              <p>
                Each of the functions uses our shared codebase as a library, and
                that - again - means that they are coupled, just as they were by
                the database. When we want to change how we reserve a book, that
                means changes to the shared model, and those changes ripple out
                to these functions. Things that change together ship together,
                so these are all a single deployment boundary.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is why you should avoid sharing libraries between
                microservices as much as possible. DRY turns out to be a bad
                heuristic in microservice architectures, because re-use is
                coupling, and the whole point of microservices is to avoid
                coupling these distinct components.

            <h1>Temporal coupling</h1>
            <aside>
              There's another kind of coupling that's present in our systems,
              and that's _temporal_ coupling.

            <h3>Temporal coupling in book borrowing</h3>

            <img
              src="assets/img/temporal_coupling.excalidraw.png"

            <aside>
              <p>
                If one component is temporally coupled to another, then it's
                unable to return a result independently. It has to _wait_ for
                the other component to respond. In this scenario, we have a Book
                service, and a User service, and when you want to check out a
                book, the checkout service has to call the book service to
                update the book's state. This kind of RPC-oriented integration
                is really common amongst microservice people, and it's horrible
                and painful and bad, because this checkout service can't do its
                job if the other service is broken.
              </p>
              <p>
                In other words, the checkout service is coupled to these other
                services in _time_. It's coupled because you have to wait. A
                request that comes in here can't be completed until the requests
                are completed here and here. If one of those requests breaks,
                then so does your request.

            <h2>Event-Driven architecture reduces temporal coupling</h2>
            <aside>
              The solution to this is to avoid synchronous calls between systems
              if possible. Instead we want to do the smallest amount of work we
              can in this checkout service, and then the rest of the work can
              happen later.

            <aside>
              <p>
                In our case that means we want to record that a user has checked
                out a book, and then raise an event "Book Checked Out". The book
                service can receive that event and update its local database.
                This way, the original request is able to complete even if
                there's a problem over here in the book service.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is a _temporal_ boundary. We've drawn a line where some
                things have to happen together, and some things can be deferred
                until later. Cazoo do this a _lot_. We hardly have any service
                to service API calls - instead everything is driven through
                events.

              <p>
                For example, when you buy a car, we raise an event called
                OrderPlaced, and we use that to trigger payments, and to take
                the car off the website, and to schedule your delivery.
              </p>
              <p>
                The only thing that needs to happen synchronously is our storing
                your order details into the local database.
              </p>
              <p>
                But event driven architeture is tricky for a bunch of reason.
                Primarily it's tricky because you have to give up on the notion
                of consistency between components.

              So our first lens is coupling - we need to understand how changes
              ripple through our system, and how temporal coupling affects our
              requests. We want to draw small deployment boundaries and small
              temporal boundaries. We use microservices to ship small systems,
              and we use events to communicate between them. Our second lens is
              _consistency_.

              Requests through a system should see a <em>coherent</em> state
            </p>
            <aside>
              Note: Consistency is the property that two requests through a
              system will observe a coherent state. For example, in our library
              system, you've either checked a book out or you haven't - this
              isn't Schrodinger's bookshelf
            </aside>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h3>Consistency matters when making decisions</h3>
            <aside>
              Consistency is important whenever we want to make a decision. For
              example, when you return a book to our library, if it's overdue,
              we want to charge you a penalty fee. It's important that we charge
              the right person, and that we charge the right amount. It would
              suck if I return a book late, and you get charged for it, because
              the data is inconsistent somehow. Without consistency it's hard to
              make decisions, because the facts you're basing decisions on might
              be wrong.

          <section>
            <h4>Strong consistency</h4>
            <p>All requests see all updates in the same order</p>

            />
            <aside>
              There's more than one kind of consistency, and we should be aware
              of which kind we have and which kind we need. A system is strongly
              consistent if all the processes using a system see all the
              accesses to the system in the same order - so if we have the `get
              book` function and the `check book out` function, then they see
              all these updates in the same order. In a strongly consistent
              system, there is only one shared view of state. All the processes
              can agree on who has checked the book out.
            </aside>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h4>Eventual consistency</h4>
            <p>States converge to a single view over time</p>
            <img

            <aside>
              <p>
                If a system is _Eventually_ consistent, then all the processes
                using the system will _Eventually_ agree on the state. A good
                example of an eventually consistent system is DNS.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you add a new DNS record to, say, GoDaddy then it takes time
                to propogate. You might not see your new DNS entry for 10 or 15
                minutes. Some parts of the internet might not see your new entry
                for 24 hours, or even longer. Eventually, though, so long as you
                don't keep changing your DNS settings, every part of the system
                will have the same view of state.
              </p>
              <p>
                In our library system, that might mean that when we check out a
                book, it doesn't necessarily show as checked out on the website
                immediately. This is the case for Cazoo - when you buy a car, we
                use an event to remove the car from our website and, in the
                early days, that led to occasional problems where a car was
                bought by more than one customer. Big oops.

            <h1>Handling concurrency</h1>

            <aside>
              There's really two ways to handle this case. Either you stop it
              from happening at all, or you build a system that expects this
              kind of problem and can manage it gracefully.

            <h3>Pessimistic Locking</h3>
            <img src="assets/img/yer_granny_locking.excalidraw.png" />

            <aside>
              <p>
                The classic way to handle concurrency issues in a data-centric
                system is to use locking. The core idea of locking is that only
                one client is allowed to modify a resource at a time.
              </p>
              <p>
                In relational databases, we handle this by locking rows of data,
                or sometimes entire tables. This reduces the potential
                throughput of your system: the whole point is that only one
                client can access data at a time, and that means you can only
                handle one request at a time.

            <aside>
              <p>
                For example, your granny could _lock_ the book she was looking
                at while she was on the page, so that the librarian couldn't
                change it until she'd finished with it.

            <aside>
              <p>
                If you've got lots of grannies, though, all looking at bits of
                your catalogue, then you won't be able to change anything.
                That's going to get very frustrating.
              </p>
              <p>
                In particular, you can get this situation where you granny has
                locked the book, and wants to lock the check out table, but the
                librarian has locked the checkout and wants to lock the book.
                This is a dead-lock, and it results in broken websites.
              </p>

              <p>
                I've spoken to teams before who are deeply freaked out by
                concurrency, and they insist that they need to have serialized
                access to tables to avoid "race conditions". They're generally
                wrong about this, but they haven't thought through the
                consistency boundaries that would make the most sense for their
                problem.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the aggregate pattern, we match the design of our domain
                model to the consistency boundaries that make most sense.

                An aggregate is a collection of related objects. One of the
                classic examples is a shopping cart. In a shopping cart, I have
                the cart itself, which probably has some identifier, is related
                to a customer session and so on, and then I have the cart items,
                which relate to a product, have a quantity and so forth. The
                cart and its items together make up an aggregate. It's a cluster
                of objects that change together.
              </p>
              <p>
                We use our database to enforce consistency at the aggregate
                level. If I've got two shopping carts, they can both be updated
                concurrently, but only one concurrent write is allowed to an
                individual cart.

              <p>
                When we want to make a change - let's say I want to add an item
                - we do that by loading the whole cart out of the database,
                making the changes, and then persisting the whole thing again.
                We never interact with the items directly, we only work through
                this public interface - the cart. The cart represents the
                _scope_ of our persistent state.
              </p>
              <p>
                Typically, we use a Repository pattern here - repositories load
                aggregates from a database. There is no repository for loading
                "cart item". There is no way to access a cart item except by
                loading the cart, and calling methods on the cart. why? Because
                the cart is our consistency boundary.

                The only way to make changes to the items is to fetch the cart,
                and that means we never need to lock the cart items table. We
                only need to lock the cart row. Because there's no way for
                someone to modify the items without using the cart, we can use
                smaller locks and that reduces the scope for deadlocks and
                performance problems.

                In serverless, we tend not to use relational databases, because
                they're a nuisance and you need connection pools and usernames
                and schema migrations, and all that boring stuff we want to
                leave to Amazon. Instead the database of choice for serverless
                applications is Dynamo. Here is how to implement an aggregate
                pattern with Dynamo DB.
              </p>
              <p>
                Objects in Dynamo DB have two keys - the partition key and the
                sort key. Every operation in the Dynamo API (except scans)
                requires a partition key. Why? Because the partition is the unit
                of consistency. Whenever I make a change, I have to make a
                change to a single partition.
              </p>

                The easiest way to implement a lock in DynamoDB is to use
                version numbers. We could create a new cart object, and when we
                create the cart is has version "0".

              <p>
                Whenever we update a book somehow, we increment the version

                Caveat lector: he uses the word "aggregate" on this page to mean

                This expression will add one to our version, that's here in the
                UpdateExpression clause, and we will fail if the version number
                doesn't match what we expect. So if cart isn't still version
                zero, we'll fail with a concurrency error.

                I've got some sample code for this in the github repository that
                contains the slides so you can have a look and see how it works.
                The code is for example purposes only, so please don't put it in
                production, but it does demonstrate the concept.

            <h1>Aggregates balance safety and performance</h1>
            <aside>
              <p>
                The aggregate pattern was first described as a solution to
                relational database performance problems. We have this
                trade-off, where we can lock _more_ - so only person can use the
                library at a time - in exchange for safety, or lock _less_ - so
                that Granny accidentally checks out softcore BDSM porn - in
                exchange for better throughput.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the aggregate pattern, we explicitly define consistency
                boundaries at the domain model level. Instead of relying on our
                database to lock objects, we build our own locks.

            <aside>
              <p>
                This is because we only need consistency when we're making
                decisions. In this context a decision is a policy that we apply
                when we change state in our system.
              </p>
              <p>
                For example, coming back to our example at Cazoo, it's important
                that when you pay for a shopping cart, you pay the right amount
                for the items in the cart. We need to make a decision whether to
                accept your payment or not, and that decisions depends on the
                items you've added, and the amount you're paying us. If we don't
                have strong consistency we could have a bug where a customer can
                add an air freshener and a car, but only pay us for the air
                freshener.

              The biggest problem people have when designing aggregates is that

            <aside>
              <p>
                In our library model customers need to be able to check books in
                and out, they should be able to reserve books over the internet,
                and they should receive fines if they return a book late.
              </p>
              <p>What are the aggregates?</p>
            </aside>

            <h3>Is our aggregate the book?</h3>
            <img src="assets/img/book_class.excalidraw.png" class="r-stretch" />
            <aside>
              <p>
                But remember that when I want to mutate the state of an
                aggregate, I'm going to load the whole thing into memory. do I
                need the complete history of a book to make borrowing decisions?
              </p>
              <p>
                What are the operations exposed by a book aggregate? I can check
                a book out, I can check a book in. If the book is late, do I
                apply the fine to _the book_? That doesn't sound right - fines
                are applied to a single customer, not to the book as a whole.
              </p>
              <p>
                If I want to check out a book at version 3, but someone else has
                paid a fine on version 3, should my request fail? That doesn't
                seem correct. The consistency boundary is too large.

            <h3>Our aggregate is the <em>loan</em></h3>
            <img src="assets/img/loan_class.excalidraw.png" class="r-stretch" />
            <aside>
              <p>
                Pragmatically, it makes more sense to choose the Loan as the
                aggregate. What operations does a loan have? I can start a loan,
                I can return a loan, I can report that my dog has eaten the
                book, and that's _it_. The loan contains all the information I
                need to know in order to make a decision: was this book returned
                on time?
              </p>
              <p>
                We've made our consistency boundary really small. We require
                that each individual lending is internally consistent - we can't
                have two updates to the same lending at once - but we _don't_
                require a single consistent view of the "book". The book does
                not exist in our borrowing model. That seems like a problem,
                though - humans think in terms of books.

              To solve this, we use _view models_. The aggregate pattern is only
              applicable when we're talking about code that makes _decisions_.
              We use repositories, and aggregates, in code that is going to
              change state. For code that _reads_ state, we can use a different
              set of patterns.

                We can think about our system as having two "sides" - the
                write-side, where we make decisions and change state - and the
                read-side where we only care about getting data in the quickest
                way we can.
              </p>
              <p>
                These two sides don't have to be perfectly consistent. So long
                as each "lending" is consistent, it's okay for our "book" view
                to be a few milliseconds out of date. If someone tries to check
                out a book, they have to do that through this stronly consistent
                write-side.

            <aside>
              <p>
                The simplest way to build this kind of system - a CQRS system -
                in serverless is to use change streams.
              </p>
              <p>
                In this model we have two dynamo tables, but we could use a
                single table, it's just easier to show this way.
              </p>
              <p>
                The _lending_ aggregate lives in this table over on the top.
                Whenever we insert a record, or update a record, that results in
                an event on the Dynamo change stream.
              </p>
              <p>
                We handle that event with a lambda function that publishes it
                over EventBridge. Our subscriber lambda down at the bottom
                receives the event and updates the search database.
              </p>
              <p>
                So this is how we handle consistency issues between boundaries -
                we identify the boundary where we _need_ things to be strongly
                consistent, we model those boundaries using the aggregate
                pattern, and then we use techniques like CQRS to give eventual
                consistency between those boundaries.
              </p>
              <p>
                But how do we know what _needs_ to be consistent? How do we find
                the loan aggregates?

                Cohesion means stickiness, it means that things clump together.
                Cohesion in the context of software engineering is the degree to
                which parts of a thing work together. The parts of a watch are
                highly cohesive. They all work together smoothly, and if you
                remove a part, the whole thing stops.

                If things are coherent, then they belong together. It's natural

                these bounded contexts are highly coherent, and that means there

              stuff that we couldn't find a better place for. Utils packages
              tend to become giant balls of string, all tangled up, and they
              tend to be coupled to everything else. We talked about this at the

                affect both of these systems. We've introduced _coupling_

                By contrast, a well-designed package has _high_ cohesion. Inside
                a package, all the components should be closely related, they
                _should_ be talking to each other. Between packages we want to
                reduce our surface area. In a well-designed package we have a
                small number of public types and functions that _abstract_ a
                large number of private types and functions.
              </p>
              <p>
                In our borrowing context we have only a couple of public types -
                loan and penalty fee - and all the internal details are hidden
                away. By contrast in a utils package, everything is public - by
                definition.

              Finding cohesive boundaries is _hard_. This is the hardest thing
              to get right, because - like aggregates - the boundaries are often
              unintuitive at first. This is the thing I was talking about at the
              beginning - the thing that Cazoo struggled with and still struggle
              with today. It's really complicated. I'm going to show you the
              heuristic I used when breaking Cazoo apart, which has mostly
              worked well.

            <aside>
              <p>
                Bounded contexts are a way for us to describe subsets of our
                solution. The overall problem we have is "manage a library" but
                that's a really big and unwieldy problem. What we need to do is
                break it down into smaller, more manageable chunks.

              <p>
                Again, our natural inclination is to look for nouns that we're
                familiar with. In our library example, the intuitive solution is
                to build a Book service that does ... everything.
              </p>
              <p>
                If we want to avoid building a giant ball of mud, we need to
                think in terms of the use-cases of our system. Instead of nouns,
                we have to look for _verbs_.
              </p>
              <p>
                If we return to our original view of the system, we've got four
                major use cases:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Customers "Borrow"</li>
                <li>Customers "Pay fines"</li>
                <li>Librarians "Maintain catalogue items"</li>
                <li>Both users "Query"</li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                Each of these is a separate process. Each of these has its own
                requirements for the model. They're all about books, sort of,
                but those books don't have much overlap.

              <p>
                In the Borrowing context we have a Lending aggregate with a
                checkout date, and a due date for return. We have a reservation
                aggregate with an expiry date, and a collection date. These
                aggregates are not consistent, but they are coherent because
                they both affect the availability of a book. A reservation will
                eventually turn into a loan.
              </p>
              <p>
                When your gran returns dirty lust three weeks late she has to
                pay a penalty fee. Again, this is a separate aggregate, but it's
                part of the same solution space.

                In the Catalogue context, we have much richer information about
                a book - we need to know the title, the classification for the
                book, the author and so on. We need to know which branch has the
                physical item.

            <aside>
              <p>
                In the search context, we take date from the borrowing context
                and the catalogue context to build a searchable index for our
                customers and librarians. In this context, we don't care _which_
                user has got a book checked out, or whether it was returned on
                time. We only care whether the book is currently available or
                not.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the catalogue context, we want to use a classification number
                to tell us what the book is about, but here in the search
                context we translate that classification number to a set of
                searchable tags.

                We can construct a map of these concepts like this. This is
                called a _context_ map and it describes how the parts of our
                system interrelate at a conceptual level.
              </p>
              <p>
                We draw out the relationships between our contexts. Both the
                borrowing and search contexts are down-stream of the catalogue
                context because they receive data from it.
              </p>
              <p>
                The payments context depends on Stripe, and has some code - an
                anti-corruption layer - that converts between Stripe's API model
                and our internal domain model.
              </p>
              <p>
                Notice that there _is no book object_. Catalogue items, loans,
                reservations, payments, index items.
              </p>
              <p>
                We don't need a book service, because book is a noun, and our
                systems should be focused on process.
              </p>
              <p>
                Each of these three bounded contexts has its own specific domain
                jargon. That's what a bounded context _is_ - it's the set of
                concepts that you need to understand in order to solve problems.
                If you're an archivist, you need to know about classifications,
                and catalogue items. If you're a librarian, you need to know
                about stock takes and damage reports. If you're a customer, you
                need to know when to return an item, and whether you're over
                due. These things don't overlap at all. They're bounded - inside
                the boundary we use one set of concepts with a rigorous
                definition.

                that other systems can be eventually consistent. In this case,
                your granny reserves her Maeve Binchy book, and we notify the
                search service via EventBridge. The search service can then
                update to say that item is not currently available.
